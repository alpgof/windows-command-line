How to List only Running or Stopped  Services in PowerShell
In this section we are going to see how to list the windows services based on a Specific State they are in.

To List, Either only Running and Stopped Services, PowerShell Get-Service Command can be used along with one more Filtering command named Where-Object .

It acts like a grep of Linux and it does the job so perfect and precise

So to List Running or Stopped Services in Windows Command line you should do the following

Open PowerShell Terminal or PowerShell ISE as Administrator
Use one of the following command based on your requirement
To List Only The Running Services
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running" }
To List only the Stopped Services
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Stopped" }
In fact,  You can Use any of the Following State Value in place of Running or Stopped to get the Services in that State.

Value	Meaning
ContinuePending	The service has been paused and is about to continue.
Paused	The service is paused.
PausePending	The service is in the process of pausing.
Running	The service is running.
StartPending	The service is in the process of starting.
Stopped	The service is not running.
StopPending	The service is in the process of stopping.
For example, If you would like to Get a Service which is in Paused State  then your command should be like this

Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Paused" }
 

 
How to List a Service or Get Service by Name in Windows
